## About Us
### Historical Accomplishments
#### Tigers
Many people take our striped friends for granted, completely unaware of a world before they existed.  
Prior to their existence, Zebras were the only animals who had such gloriously-vertical striations.
In our lab, back during a time immemorial, our scientists were able to successfully cross-breed Zebras and Lions.
The orange brilliance of their coats is due to the voracious diet of Puffy Cheetos that our lions were consuming, generously donated by our primary investor, Chester Cheetah. 
We found that the consistent diet of Cheetos also helped prevent the Lions from consistently eating their Zebra partners rather than enjoying them as bed partners.
